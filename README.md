## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Comprehensive Solutions**: Each problem is solved with clear, efficient code.  
- **Languages Used**: Python, C++, JavaScript (or the ones you use).  
- **Key Topics**:  
  - Backtracking (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku Solver)  
  - Dynamic Programming (e.g., Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence)  
  - Graph Algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)  
  - Recursion & Divide-and-Conquer  
  - Other problem-solving techniques

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

The repository is organized into folders by topic:  

- **`Backtracking/`**: Problems like N-Queens, Sudoku Solver  
- **`Dynamic_Programming/`**: Problems like Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence  
- **`Graph_Algorithms/`**: Problems like BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra  

Each folder contains code files with solutions and comments explaining the logic.
